excerpt: 'This work presents a risk-aware modeling approach that
incorporates the uncertainties of service deployments while
enabling BESS to provide multiple services. The approach
is complimented with a co-simulation framework for testing and evaluating the true service potential of the BESS.
The proposed approach enables the BESS to provide their
committed services by responding to the service deployments
at all times and thereby guarantees service provision to the
system operator. Results also indicate that the deployment
uncertainties, when not considered, would over-estimate the
BESSâ€™s potential, leading to failures in service-provision.
Ensuring the quality of service is key step towards enabling
BESS for providing multiple services and thereby enhancing
their revenue-stacking potential.
Future extension of this work would aim towards including
network constraints like voltage limits, and substation limits
in the formulation. Another direction of future work would be
towards investigating the BESS potential for short time service provision (for e.g., 15-minute regulation markets) by utilizing
any available BESS energy due to under-deployed reserves.'

Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are emerging as a promising, versatile technology for modern power grids due to their inherent distributed nature, their ability to provide bidirectional injections and multiple grid services. With the proliferation of intermittent renewable energy resources, the BESS procurement is also expected to increase, thereby creating systematic and strategic opportunities for BESS to leverage revenue streams by providing multiple services. However, many of these services involve uncertainties which when not considered may lead to failures in service-provision. This work presents a risk-aware control strategy that takes into account the uncertainties around some of the stochastic services and ensures the BESS to deliver their service commitments. Utilizing a co-simulation architecture, this work also presents an evaluation framework to determine the true potential of utility-scale BESS for simultaneous provision of multiple services. The proposed framework is implemented for BESS installed in a real-world feeder and their performance trade-offs on multi-service provision are quantified. This promotes overall grid reliability and encourages BESS implementation through revenue stacking from providing multiple grid services.
