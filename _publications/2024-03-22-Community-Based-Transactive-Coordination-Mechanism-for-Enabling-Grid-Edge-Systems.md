collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-03-22-Community-Based-Transactive-Coordination-Mechanism-for-Enabling-Grid-Edge-Systems
excerpt: 'Towards enabling localized coordination through a shared
energy economy, this work presents a community-based transactive coordination framework. The framework presents a
scheduling and bidding strategy for communities with DERs
like BESS to facilitate RT market-based coordination between
the communities and LSE. Partnering with the local utility,
the effectiveness of the mechanism is evaluated for a reallife use-case implemented using a co-simulation platform. The
evaluation of transactive coordination demonstrated its impact
on reducing overall energy costs for each of the community districts, showcasing the benefits of coordinated energy
trading among districts. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of community-based markets in coordinating the
flexibility of grid-edge systems and reducing the operational
cost compared to existing pricing structures.
Future work includes extending the framework to incorporate the flexibility of the thermal storage-based resource and deploying the mechanism for field-testing. While this work
demonstrates the use-case of arbitrage as a service, changes
to agent objective functions can be extended to include other
ancillary services (such as Volt-VAR support, spinning reserve,
etc.). Incorporating the recovery of fixed costs for energy
delivery presents another avenue for future research.

The changing landscape of the electricity industry, characterized by a surge in distributed energy resources (DERs) and proactive customers, necessitates practical solutions for coor-dinated operation especially at the distribution-level. This paper introduces a community-based trans active coordination mecha-nism designed to incentivize customers for providing localized and system-level services reflected through real-time prices. The work presents a bidding approach for communities, representing collectives of customers, to formulate their price-responsiveness for retail energy coordination, thereby emphasizing a community-centric model. By sending bidding curves to a third-party, the mechanism enables customers with DER assets to actively participate in localized coordination with the Load Serving Entity (LSE), thereby supplementing each other's and even the utility's needs through a shared energy economy. The proposed transactive mechanism is implemented leveraging a co-simulation framework that integrates a distribution grid simulator with control agents for performance evaluation. Simulation-based evaluation on a real distribution system use-case, in collaboration with a local utility, demonstrate the potential of the mechanism to reduce costs by 12% for communities with DERs like solar photovoltaic (PV) and battery energy storage systems (BESS).
